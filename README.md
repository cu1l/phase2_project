# phase2_project

Our idea equips users with travel information on national parks and landmarks. Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Zion, Joshua Tree, etc. For more popular destinations, we'll  include local parks and landmarks (i.e. for New York - Niagra Falls, Central Park, Statue of Liberty).

## Travel Locations 
As a user, I should be able to fill out a form to log in (or sign up) to the site and be prompted to see popular travel destinations.

As a user, I should be able to select a location destination fetched from the json database.

As a user, I should be able to favorite certain travel destinations.

As a user, I should be able to view a list of my favorited location destinations.

As a user, I should be taken to a "page" with the image, description, and nearby hotels (possibly on map?) of the selected location.
